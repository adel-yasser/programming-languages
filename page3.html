<td>C++ is a compiled language.
The source program written in C++ is compiled into an object code which can then be executed to produce an output.</td>

<td>C++ supports various types of inheritances including single and multiple inheritances.Although there are problems arising from multiple inheritances, C++ uses the virtual keyword to resolve the problems.</td>
<td>Java, supports only single inheritance.Effects of multiple inheritance can be achieved using the interfaces in Java.</td>
